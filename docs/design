Blog Model Design

Model for blog entry should contain:
    title       char
    author      char
    tags        ????
    slug        char
    body        char
    created     timestamp defaults to created datetime
    updated     datetime defaults to most recent modification
    published   boolean if article should be displayed publicly




TODO

    Add sitemap
    Create slugs that can be used to bookmark pages
    Create contact form to send emails (tie in mail server)
    Create monthly views
    Render 3-5 blog articles on each /blog page that the user clicks through
    Sort blogs by date
    Ensure that "published" prevents blogs from rendering before they are ready
    Tie in first click on published with publication date 
    For DB use MySPL or postgres    
    
    
Nice-To-Have
    
    Commenting on the blog (needs user auth - look into auth redux)
    


Pre-deploy checklist:
- choose between cdn and local static files for bootstrap CSS.
- ensure to turn off debug setting before going live.
- Security - validate ALL input fields properly
