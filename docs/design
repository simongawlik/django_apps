Blog Model Design

Model for blog entry should contain:
    title       char
    user        char (foreignkey from users)
    tags        ????
    slug        char
    body        char
    created     timestamp defaults to created datetime
    updated     datetime defaults to most recent modification
    published   boolean if article should be displayed publicly


=============================================================================

TODO

    Add tags to articles
    Add sitemap
    Create contact form to send emails (tie in mail server)
    Create views grouped by author
    Create views grouped by month
    Create views grouped by year
    Create views grouped by tag
    Ensure that "published" prevents blogs from rendering before they are ready
    Tie in first click on published with publication date 
    For DB use MySPL or postgres    
    
    
Nice-To-Have
    
    Commenting on the blog (needs user auth - look into auth redux)
    playground to showcase other projects


Pre-deploy checklist:
- choose between cdn and local static files for bootstrap CSS.
