hello, world!
Hi! My name is Simon and I am a business and systems analyst at Exeter Group in Boston, MA. While at Exeter, I gained my first experiences in tech consulting and project management. In an effort to learn more about tech and to overhaul the company website, I taught myself a bit of webdesign as well as some basic programming. This website is the result of it. I tried to teach myself from scratch so everything you see was fed into a mainframe on punched cards (Citation needed).
Before starting my professional career at Exeter, I received my Master's degree in Management Research from Oxford University. My final thesis used sentiment analysis on large amounts of social media data to aid the decision making process and corporate communications of senior management.
Leading up to my Master's degree, I received my Bachelor's degree from Harvard University where I was an Economics major and also received a citation in French. During my years at Harvard, my coursework included Behavioral, Social, International Trade, and Financial Economics.
From the age of 11 onward, I was a dedicated rower, competing for the German National Team, Oxford University, and Harvard University at the highest levels until ending my athletic career in 2011 at age 26. I stay involved in rowing by volunteering at events, coaching occasionally, and participating in Alumni racing.
I was born and raised in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, before attending college. I attended public schools and rowed for my home club, RC Nassovia HÃ¶chst. After school and training I would lie down on a couch and enjoy daily ethics lectures (Star Trek TNG - I was Lt. Comm. Data for carnival when I was about 9 years old. I didn't win best costume even though my mom tailored her heart out for me, I died my hair black, and painted my face white. The judges must have been Star Wars fans).
